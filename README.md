# Image Classification using HOG + SVM

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to classify images into different cat breeds using machine learning techniques.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various cat breeds. The dataset includes a collection of images, each labeled with the corresponding cat breed. The images were obtained from different sources and carefully curated to ensure a diverse representation of cat breeds.

# Requirements

To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image
- numpy
- matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
